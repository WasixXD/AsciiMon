# How it works? üíº
So I only use a graphics library called *ncurses* that the main engine behind at all, so after initialize everything every input that the player makes we capture and see if a event has occurred, so if the player is standing in a grass tile ("w") we just calculate a random factor that says if a wild mon wants to battle. In the battle we transfer the control to a new function that handles all the events that can happen (like using a move, or changing the mons order). The battle also can occur when the player enter a trainer sight then again we transfer the control and make the same process. Other things like seeing a item info are just a while loop that display the info while the input are to not close, seems simple but using such a library that have even simplier functions is difficult


<br>

# How to install üöÄ

- Be sure to have ncurses installed
```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```
- On windows if you use MingW64 or MSYS you are very likely to already have it
___
- Now clone and navigate to the repository folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WasixXD/AsciiMon
cd AsciiMon
```
- Be sure to make the `script.sh` executable
  ```bash
  chmod +x ./script.sh
  ```
  
- And just run it with
  ```bash
  ./script.sh
  ```
